## Agenda
- 9:00 am  doors open
- 9:30 am  Sprint begins with Andreas Mueller introducing Contributing process

- Arrive early at 9:00 am for any installation or technical questions.

- Please [update your RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-WiMLDS/events/259491883/) if you are no longer able to attend; we have a number of people who were unable to register due to limited space.  

- The event is on a Saturday in NYC, which can possibly mean ---> subway delays.  Check out the MTA Weekender to see if your transit line is impacted:  http://web.mta.info/weekender.html
